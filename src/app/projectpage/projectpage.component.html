            <li><a href="https://github.com/CMRicketts/dnd" target="_blank"><strong>dnd</strong></a>: a command line Dungeons and Dragons character creator application.
            Version 1.0 finished, working on Version 2.0. This python-powered application is a data-driven application
              to help D&D players create and keep track of their characters</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/CMRicketts/dndOnline" target="_blank"><strong>dndOnline</strong></a>: a work in progress Dungeons and Dragons
            character creator application written in Python with a Django framework. Includes database storage of created characters available behind
              authentication, and upload/download characters.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/CMRicketts/self_page" target="_blank"><strong>This Website</strong></a>: A long time dream, fulfilled. This website
            was created during the summer of 2018 with the intention of getting my name out and developing my front-end skills. It was created using
            an Angular JS backend, with a Bulma framework for the HTML. I also used GitPages to host the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Realm V Design Studio Intern</strong>: I interned on a capstone project for Raikes juniors and seniors for Realm V.
              I architected and refactored new core functionality, ensured the quality of the database through interlinked data entries,
              worked with geospatial data tracking, and unit tested every bit of code I created (and then some).
              The project was written in Ruby, and was developed under the Agile Methodology framework.</li>

          <li><strong>Jdekipedia Update:</strong> I manually updated the codebase of a Wikipedia-like website from its 2007 standards to today's coding conventions.
          This project involved learning and understanding legacy code, and how it differed from it's current version. I had to go in and manually update many
          extensions used, as they had stopped maintenance in the past 10 years. I also had to manage the database entries for the website and make sure the
          old code adheres to the new standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading and Leading:</strong> A summer seminar where I taught children how to read, and high school students about
          leadership skills I learned at Culver Military Academy. It was for my Senior Service Project; a capstone project for my high school: Culver Military Academy.
          At the end of the summer, my partner on the project and I made a website for the entire project, which was used by Culver to
          promote the Senior Service Project curriculum.</li>

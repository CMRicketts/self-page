          <li><strong>Summer 2019 - Microsoft Corporation</strong>:
            I worked as a software developer intern for the Bing Local Maps division. While in this position,
            I was tasked with creating a new framework for the Map Entity Collections pages on mobile. This new framework allowed
            users to see their created collections, view those entities on a map, and interact with those
            entities. Outside of the project parameters, I introduced a new unified CSS solution that reduced the complexity
            of the code as well as unified the views' styles. You can see an example of the framework and CSS style on
            <a href="https://github.com/CMRicketts/BingMapsMobile" target="_blank">my github.</a>
            While working on this, I developed and refined my skills in C#, HTML/CSS, the .NET Framework, Razor, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

          <li><strong>Summer 2018 - Zillow Group</strong>:
            I worked as a software engineer intern for their Mortech Office in Lincoln, Nebraska. In this position,
            I developed an internal tool to assist developers by tracking their released code through the various stages
            of Zillow's stages of production. Through this internship, I learned about the relationship between the front-end
            pages, back-end codebases, and cloud-based resources. At the end of the summer, I had developed my skills in
            Amazon Web Services API's and Lambdas, HTML/CSS, Python, TypeScript, and Angular significantly.

          <li><a href="https://cmricketts.github.io/worldMap/#/main" target="_blank"><strong>UN World Map</strong></a>:
            a data visualization website that either displays global UN Data over a map of the world, or tells the user about statistical information they selected.
            This application was built using several libraries, mainly <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3" target="_blank">d3.</a> The user is able to choose between three
            different views based on how many datasets and how many years are selected.</li>

            This python-powered application is a data-driven application
            to help D&D players create and keep track of their characters</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/CMRicketts/self_page" target="_blank"><strong>This Website</strong></a>: A long time dream, fulfilled. This website
            was created during the summer of 2018 with the intention of getting my name out and developing my front-end skills. It was created using
            an Angular JS backend, with a Bulma framework for the HTML. I also used GitPages to host the site.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://realmfive.com/" target="_blank">Realm V</a>  Design Studio Intern</strong>: I interned on a capstone project for Raikes juniors and seniors for <a href="http://realmfive.com/" target="_blank">Realm V.</a>
            I architected and refactored new core functionality, ensured the quality of the database through interlinked data entries,
            worked with geospatial data tracking, and unit tested every bit of code I created.
            The project was written in Ruby, and was developed using the Agile Methodology framework.</li>

          <li><strong>Jdekipedia Update:</strong> I manually updated the codebase of a Wikipedia-like website from its 2007 standards to today's coding conventions.
          This project involved learning and understanding legacy code, and how it differed from it's current version. I had to go in and manually update many
          extensions used, as they had stopped maintenance in the past 10 years. I also had to manage the database entries for the website and make sure the
          old code adheres to the new standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading and Leading:</strong> A summer seminar where I taught children how to read and high school students about
            leadership skills I learned at <a href="https://www.culver.org/" target="_blank">Culver Military Academy.</a> It was for my Senior Service Project; a capstone project for my high school: <a href="https://www.culver.org/" target="_blank">Culver Military Academy.</a>
            At the end of the summer, my partner on the project and I made a website for the entire project, which was used by Culver to
          promote the Senior Service Project curriculum.</li>
